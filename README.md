# Introduction


**LLY-GP** is part of the [**LILY Project**](https://www.lilyqml.de) and focuses on optimization parameter-based quantum circuits. It enhances the efficiency of quantum algorithms by fine-tuning parameters of quantum gates. **GP** stands for **Generativ Qubit Processing**, which assigns each word the state of a multi-qubit system and recognizes words through a quantum machine learning process. This approach leverages gradient-based optimization techniques to improve the performance of quantum circuits.

The primary goal of **LLY-GP** is to recognize and assign languages, making it a foundational element in the development of language-aware models. As the LILY Project evolves, **LLY-GP** will become increasingly important, serving as a critical component in more advanced quantum machine learning models.

LLY-GP is available on the [LILY QML platform](https://www.lilyqml.de), making it accessible for researchers and developers.

## Model Usage

**LLY-GP** is a Quantum Machine Learning model that plays a crucial role in the development of future models within the **LILY Project**. It combines the gate properties of the **DML model** with a tokenizer, creating a robust foundation for future applications. This model acts as a precursor to the **GLLM model**, which leverages the properties of **GP** to function like a Large Language Model (LLM).

By integrating these innovative techniques, **LLY-GP** significantly enhances the efficiency and performance of language models. With its ability to merge quantum mechanics and machine learning, **LLY-GP** is set to play a central role in the development of new quantum-based applications and systems.


## Functionality

The model is based on **Generativ Qubit Processing (GP)**, which assigns each word the state of a multi-qubit system. This method enables precise word recognition and processing through quantum-based machine learning techniques.
